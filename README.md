## Getting Started

To get started with this React setup, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/NonorCoding/react-setup.git your-project-name`.
2. Change into the project directory: `cd your-project-name`.
3. Install the project dependencies: `npm install`.
4. Start the development server: `npm start`.

You should now have the React application running on your local machine. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action. Any changes you make to the source code will automatically update the application in the browser.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

your-project/
├── public/
│ ├── index.html
│ ├── robots.txt
│ └── favicon.ico
├── src/
│ ├── components/
│ │ └── Navigation.js
│ ├── pages/
│ │ └── Home.js
│ │ └── About.js
│ ├── styles/
│ │ ├── components/
│ │ │ └── _navigation.scss
│ │ ├── _settings.scss
│ │ └── index.scss
│ ├── App.js
│ └── index.js
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
└── README.md

- The `public` directory contains the `index.html` file, which is the entry point for your React application, along with the `robots.txt` and `favicon.ico` files.
- The `src` directory is where you'll place your React components, pages, and styles.
- The `components` directory inside `src` is where you'll create and organize your reusable React components.
- The `pages` directory inside `src` is where you'll define your different pages or views.
- The `styles` directory inside `src` contains your Sass files for styling.
- The `App.js` file is the main React component that acts as the root of your application.
- The `index.js` file is the entry point for rendering the React application.
- The `.gitignore` file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
- The `package.json` file lists the project dependencies and includes scripts for various tasks.
- The `README.md` file provides information about the project and its setup instructions.

## Dependencies

This React setup includes the following dependencies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- ReactDOM: A package for rendering React components in the browser.
- React Router DOM: A package for declarative routing in React applications.
- Sass: A CSS preprocessor that enables the use of variables, mixins, and more.
- Web Vitals: A package for measuring real-world performance metrics of your application.

These dependencies are automatically installed when you run `npm install` in the project directory.

## Scripts

The following scripts are available in the project:

- `npm start`: Starts the development server and opens the application in your default browser.
- `npm build`: Builds the application for production, generating optimized and minified files.
- `npm test`: Runs tests for your React application.
- `npm eject`: Ejects the create-react-app configuration, allowing you to customize the build configuration.

You can run these scripts using `npm run <script-name>`.
